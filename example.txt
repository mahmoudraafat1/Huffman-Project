In 1952 David A.Huffman the student of MIT discover this algorithm during work on his term paper assigned by his professor Robert M.fano.The idea came in to his mind that using a frequency sorted binary tree we can able to find out the most efficient binary code[1].Huffman deny the major flaw of Claude Shannon Fano coding by building the tree from bottom up instead of from the  top down .There is a lot of compression algorithm but we focus on losslessIn 1952 David A.Huffman the student of MIT discover this algorithm during work on his term paper assigned by his professor Robert M.fano.The idea came in to his mind that using a frequency sorted binary tree we can able to find out the most efficient binary code[1].Huffman deny the major flaw of Claude Shannon Fano coding by building the tree from bottom up instead of from the  top down .There is a lot of compression algorithm but we focus on losslessIn 1952 David A.Huffman the student of MIT discover this algorithm during work on his term paper assigned by his professor Robert M.fano.The idea came in to his mind that using a frequency sorted binary tree we can able to find out the most efficient binary code[1].Huffman deny the major flaw of Claude Shannon Fano coding by building the tree from bottom up instead of from the  top down .There is a lot of compression algorithm but we focus on lossless In 1952 David A.Huffman the student of MIT discover this algorithm during work on his term paper assigned by his professor Robert M.fano.The idea came in to his mind that using a frequency sorted binary tree we can able to find out the most efficient binary code[1].Huffman deny the major flaw of Claude Shannon Fano coding by building the tree from bottom up instead of from the  top down .There is a lot of compression algorithm but we focus on losslessIn 1952 David A.Huffman the student of MIT discover this algorithm during work on his term paper assigned by his professor Robert M.fano.The idea came in to his mind that using a frequency sorted binary tree we can able to find out the most efficient binary code[1].Huffman deny the major flaw of Claude Shannon Fano coding by building the tree from bottom up instead of from the  top down .There is a lot of compression algorithm but we focus on lossless
