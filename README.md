# Huffman-Project
Hu�man encoding is an example of a lossless compression algorithm that works particularly well on text but can, in fact, be applied to any type of file. Using Hu�man encoding to compress a file can reduce the storage it requires by a third, half, or even more, in some situations. Youʼll be impressed with the compression algorithm, and youʼll be equally impressed that youʼre outfitted to implement the core of a tool that imitates one youʼre already very familiar with.
